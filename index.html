        <h1>Electron documentation</h1>
        <p>Hello welcome to my language Electron. This language was made for fun and isn't really <br> usefull but is sorta usefull with numbers. To install 1. Install a python text editor (for <br>example atom) 2. Create a file (you must name it electron.py or else your code won't work 3. Go to this  <a href='https://github.com/Supercoder21/Electron/tree/main'>link</a> (it sends you to github) and copy and paste the code from electron.py and put it in your electron.py 4. This is the final step go back to this <a href='https://github.com/Supercoder21/Electron/tree/main'>link</a> and copy mycode.py now make a new file in your text editor (name it anything you want but it must end with .py) and paste the code in it. Now you set up your electron code editor!<br><br><h3>How to Use</h3>Now that you're done installing electron you can go to the file you made in step 4 and find the line that says var = '''...''' delete the ... part and put in your code in between the ''' ''' The rules are simple</p>

        <ul>
            <li>() go around operators. Operators are symbols that can do arithmethic such as * + / - Operators can't have anything else than that (except the two parenthesis of course) if they are anything diffrent the program will ignore it. For operators examples in code (*) or (+)</li>
            <h3></h3>
            <li>!! go around whole numbers. For example !5!. Remember if a number is natural it's positive or it's zero. Also in the language ! doesn't mean factorial (there is a whole diffrent function for that called factorial) Also something with a @@ around it is a negitve whole number for example @-5@ </li>
            <h3></h3>
            <li><> go around decimal numbers. That for example it means code that looks like this &lt;3.14> or &lt;345.678> . Also the number is positive. Same as Operators and int's it will be ignored if you put <> and in between anything other than a decimal.Them and whole numbers and negitive floats and negitive whole numbers are a type called num. Also something with > &lt;  is a negitive decimal like >-5.10&lt;</li>
            <h3></h3>
            <li>Finally there is something called a string (abr. is str) that has == signs around it. Strings are basicly text that can be made with numbers and letters but not any special charecters. For example =Hello= is a string that means hello. A string has only one function where it can be correctly used called say</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are also types like &-10& we'll talk about these later <h3>Functions</h3> There are many functions let's talk about the easiest. In every programming language you should be able to write hello world in this one it is say: =hello=. Say can put string and only strings on your screen when you run. Also any functions end with a :. Then they are others functions like factorial: and square (multiply's the number by it self) ,log: and sqrt: (sqaure root). These functions can have a whole arithmethic expression in them for example !5!+!6!*>-3.5&lt;. Electron will solve this for you following the rules of pedmas. Note there is no parenthesis or exponents in electron's expressions. There is also type: (a function) which tells us what type something is for example type: =hello= would result in {'str':'hello'} type: type: or any other function would result with {'func':'functions name'}. Finally there is loop:. loop can loop through numbers one through ten and do some operation like *2. The syntax for looping through !1! and !10! is loop: !1! !10! !1! &+0& which means start from 1 end at 10 then perform the expression +0 (If you see the type of a expression it would be {'expression':'whatever your expression was'}). Also ignore the !1! for now. Finally expressions can only be + or * or / or - from a certain whole number. That's my programming language electron. Bye!</p>
